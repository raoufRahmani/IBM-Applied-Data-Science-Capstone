# SpaceX First Stage Landing Prediction

## Project Overview

The commercial space age has begun, and companies like **Virgin Galactic**, **Rocket Lab**, **Blue Origin**, and **SpaceX** are competing to make space travel more affordable.

Among these, **SpaceX** has had great success. It has:

* Sent spacecraft to the International Space Station
* Launched the **Starlink** satellite internet system
* Completed manned space missions

One major reason SpaceX can reduce launch costs is because it **reuses the first stage** of its **Falcon 9** rocket. This stage is large, expensive, and does most of the work during a launch. When it lands successfully, it can be reused, saving millions of dollars. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 launches for around **\$62 million**, while other providers may cost up to **\$165 million**.

However, the first stage **does not always land**. Sometimes it crashes, and other times SpaceX chooses not to recover it due to mission requirements like payload size or orbit.

## Project Scenario

In this capstone project, we are working as a **data scientist** for a new rocket company called **Space Y**, which wants to **compete with SpaceX**. 

Our task is to:

* Use **public information** about SpaceX launches
* **Gather and analyze data**
* Build **dashboards** to help your team understand launch outcomes
* Use **machine learning** to predict whether the **first stage** will **land successfully or not**

Instead of using rocket science, we will apply **data science techniques** to estimate whether the first stage will land, and help the company **determine the cost** of a rocket launch.

## Goals

* Collect and clean SpaceX launch data
* Perform data wrangling and exploratory analysis
* Create visual dashboards
* Build and evaluate a machine learning model
* Predict first stage landing outcomes to estimate launch costs
