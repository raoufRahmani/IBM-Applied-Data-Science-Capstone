# Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is the first step in any data science project.

In the **first lab**, we perform some exploratory data analysis using a **database**.
In the **second lab**, we check if the data can help us predict if **Falcon 9â€™s first stage will land**.

Some attributes (features) can help us know if the **first stage can be reused**.
We can use these features with **machine learning** to predict if the first stage will **land successfully**.

We can see that the **success rate has improved since 2013**.
We can use the **launch number** as a feature.

Different **launch sites** have different success rates.
This can help us know if the first stage will land.
For example:

* **CCAFS LC-40** has a success rate of **60%**
* **KSC LC-39A** and **VAFB SLC 4E** have a success rate of around **77%**

Combining attributes gives us more useful information.
If we show landing outcome as a color, we see that **CCAFS LC-40** has a **60%** success rate.
But, if the **mass is above 10,000 kg**, the success rate is **100%**.

So, we will **combine multiple features**.

In the lab, we will find which attributes are **correlated with successful landings**.
Then, the **categorical variables** will be converted using **one-hot encoding**.
This prepares the data for a **machine learning model** that predicts if the **first stage will successfully land**.
