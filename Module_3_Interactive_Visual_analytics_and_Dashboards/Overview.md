# Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard

Welcome to the **Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard** module. We will use this module to build a dashboard for stakeholders.

Interactive visual analytics helps us explore and work with data in real time. Common interactions include zoom-in, zoom-out, pan, filter, search, and link. With interactive visual analytics, we can find visual patterns faster and more effectively. Instead of using static graphs, interactive data visualizations and dashboards can tell a more engaging and useful story.

In this module, we will use **Folium** and **Plotly Dash** to build an interactive map and dashboard for interactive visual analysis.

The first part of the module focuses on analyzing launch site locations and nearby areas using **Folium**. We will mark the launch site positions on an interactive map and add markers for locations close to them. Then, we can explore the map and look for patterns. By doing this, we will be able to explain how to choose an optimal launch site.

After that, we will build a dashboard application using the **Plotly Dash** package. This dashboard will include interactive input components like a dropdown list and a range slider. These inputs will allow us to control and explore a **pie chart** and a **scatter plot**. The process will be explained step-by-step in an instructional lab.

Once the dashboard is completed, we will be able to use it to get more insights from the SpaceX dataset than we could from static graphs.
